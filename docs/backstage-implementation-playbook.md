# Backstage Implementation Playbook

This playbook provides a structured approach to implementing Backstage as your Internal Developer Portal (IDP). It follows a walk-crawl-run methodology to help you progressively build and enhance your Backstage instance.

## Introduction

[Backstage](https://backstage.io) is an open platform for building developer portals, created by Spotify and now part of the CNCF. It provides a unified interface for all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation.

This playbook will guide you through the implementation process in three phases:

1. **Crawl**: Get Backstage working locally with basic configuration
2. **Walk**: Deploy to Kubernetes with authentication and real examples
3. **Run**: Production-ready setup with persistent database, monitoring, and advanced features

## Phase 1: Crawl - Local Setup and Basic Configuration

The goal of this phase is to get Backstage working locally to demonstrate its value and familiarize yourself with its capabilities.

### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment

1. **Install required software**:
   - Node.js 20 (LTS/Iron)
   ```bash
   nvm install lts/iron
   node --version  # Should show v20.x.x
   ```
   - Yarn 4.4.1
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   yarn set version 4.4.1
   yarn --version  # Should show 4.4.1
   ```
   - Git
   - Podman (optional, for containerization)

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   export BACKSTAGE_ENVIRONMENT=local
   yarn install --immutable
   yarn tsc
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Local Instance

1. **Set up basic configuration**:
   - Review and update `app-config.yaml` and `app-config.local.yaml` for your environment
   - Configure the software catalog to discover your components

2. **Set up TechDocs for local rendering**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .techdocs-venv
   source .techdocs-venv/bin/activate
   pip install --no-cache-dir mkdocs-techdocs-core==1.* mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin
   ```

### Step 3: Run Backstage Locally

1. **Build and start the application**:
   ```bash
   yarn build:backend
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Access the local instance**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Explore Basic Features

1. **Software Catalog**: Explore the structure and add sample components
2. **Documentation**: Test the TechDocs functionality with sample documentation
3. **Scaffolding**: Experiment with templates for project creation

## Phase 2: Walk - Kubernetes Deployment with Authentication

The goal of this phase is to deploy Backstage to Kubernetes with authentication and demonstrate its value with real examples.

### Step 1: Prepare for Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Create necessary namespaces**:
   - Submit a merge request for namespace creation in your Kubernetes environment
   - Ensure proper RBAC permissions are set up

2. **Set up container registry access**:
   - Configure access to your container registry
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing container images

### Step 2: Configure Authentication

1. **Set up GitLab authentication**:
   - Create a GitLab application for OAuth
   - Configure client ID and secret in Backstage
   - Update app configuration to use GitLab authentication

2. **Set up Microsoft SSO (optional for Walk phase)**:
   - Create an Azure app registration for SSO
   - Configure client ID and secret in Backstage
   - Update app configuration to use Microsoft authentication

### Step 3: Deploy to Kubernetes

1. **Create Kubernetes deployment configuration**:
   - Set up Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests
   - Configure environment-specific values (dev, qa)

2. **Deploy using ArgoCD or similar tool**:
   - Set up ArgoCD application
   - Configure sync policy and health checks

3. **Configure ingress and domain**:
   - Set up ingress controller
   - Configure domain and TLS certificates

### Step 4: Implement Real Examples

1. **Add real components to the catalog**:
   - Add `catalog-info.yaml` files to your repositories
   - Configure automatic discovery of components

2. **Set up templates for your organization**:
   - Create custom templates for your projects
   - Configure template actions for your CI/CD system

3. **Integrate with your GitLab instance**:
   - Configure GitLab integration for repository browsing
   - Set up pipeline statistics visualization

## Phase 3: Run - Production-Ready Configuration

The goal of this phase is to make Backstage production-ready with persistent storage, monitoring, and advanced features.

### Step 1: Set Up Persistent Storage

1. **Configure PostgreSQL database**:
   - Set up a managed PostgreSQL instance or deploy to Kubernetes
   - Configure Backstage to use the external database
   - Set up backup and recovery procedures

2. **Configure object storage for TechDocs**:
   - Set up S3-compatible storage
   - Configure Backstage to use external storage for TechDocs

### Step 2: Implement Monitoring and Observability

1. **Set up health checks**:
   - Configure Backstage health check endpoints
   - Set up monitoring for these endpoints

2. **Implement logging**:
   - Configure structured logging
   - Set up log aggregation and analysis

3. **Set up metrics**:
   - Configure Prometheus metrics
   - Set up Grafana dashboards

### Step 3: Enhance Security

1. **Implement proper secret management**:
   - Set up Vault integration
   - Move secrets from configuration files to Vault

2. **Configure role-based access control**:
   - Set up permission policies
   - Configure access control for different user groups

### Step 4: Scale and Optimize

1. **Configure horizontal scaling**:
   - Set up autoscaling for Backstage components
   - Optimize resource requests and limits

2. **Implement caching**:
   - Set up Redis or similar for caching
   - Configure Backstage to use the cache

### Step 5: Advanced Features

1. **Implement Microsoft Entra Tenant Data integration**:
   - Configure the Microsoft Entra provider
   - Set up automatic user and group synchronization

2. **Set up advanced search**:
   - Configure Elasticsearch or similar
   - Set up search indexing for all resources

## Conclusion

Following this playbook will help you implement Backstage in a structured and progressive manner. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing you to demonstrate value early while working towards a production-ready deployment.

Remember that Backstage is highly customizable, and you should adapt this playbook to your organization's specific needs and constraints.
