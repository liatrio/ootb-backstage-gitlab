This Playbook and Design Document are intended to guide the implementation of Backstage as the Internal Developer Portal (IDP) at a client who uses GitLab for source control.

This is meant to be a reusable solution and should be iterated on by any Liatrian team members who implement Backstage for clients. Please contribute back to this repository with any new client learnings and feedback.
